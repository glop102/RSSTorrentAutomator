AutomatedTorrentFeeds

Having several common torrent streams that I like to download, I had started using a RSS reader to keep
track of when new torrents came out. The release schedual is sporadic enough that it was a bit of a pain
to add the torents manually from the feeds and then manage the files afterwards. Since I was doing seasonal
episodes, and each feed was for a single season of a show, it was the perfect type of thing to automate.


Runtime Dependencies
python3.4+

= Gentoo =
 py-xmlrpc
 feedparser
 paramiko


Special Params
processing_steps - the steps that are taken for each torrent (see below)
        - This does have a sane default of
	   - add the torrent
	   - wait for it to finish
	   - download the files to %download_destination%
	   - do the post-processing steps
post_processing_steps - the normal place for a user to do something special with the torrents
download_destination - a folder that you want the default processing_steps to put the torrent files


Special Sectional Params
  These params are used for certain things in different sections
=====Global
server_url - we need to connect to rTorrent somewhere
credentials_type - can be one of (plain,netrc,none)
credentials - optional - specify this as Username:Password if you choose plain credentials type

=====Group
group_name - some name to use later for different feeds

=====RSSFeed
feed_url - the url to grab new entries from
group_name - optional - the name of a group to inherit things from
last_seen_link - automatically generated field to know what links are new
               - you can add this field if you know what torrent you want to start from
last_seen_link_date - automatically generated field to help servers only send new entries

=====Torrent
current_processing_step - automatically generated field to track what processing step the torrent is on
feed_url - what feed generated this torrent - auto-generated
link - the link to the torrent grabbed from the feed - auto-generated
title - the title given for the torrent link in the feed - auto-generated
published - string date of when the torrent was added to the feed - auto-generated



Available Processing Steps:

add_torrent() - will add the current torrent to rTorrent and have it start downloading
delete_torrent_only() - will remove the torrent from rTorrent but leave the files in their location
        - we will also stop tracking the torrent; since it is useless to do so with the torrent gone
delete_torrent_and_files() - will delete the current torrent and the files it downloaded
set_label(string) - set the current torrent's label to "string" (visable in ruTorrent)
wait_for_torrent_complete() - periodicly checks to see if the torrent has finished downloading into rTorrent
wait_for_ratio(int) - periodically check if the torrent has an upload ratio equal or grater than the given number
stop_tracking_torrent() - simply remove the torrent conf from this program without stopping or deleting the torrent

increment_torrent_var(string) - add 1 to a variable named "string" in the current torrent
increment_feed_var(string) - add 1 to a variable named "string" for the feed the current torrent came from
increment_group_var(string) - add 1 to a variable named "string" for the group the current torrent came from
increment_global_var(string) - add 1 to a variable named "string" in the global scope

download_files(string) - downloads all the files in the torrent to the location specified in "string"
        - special behavior for single file torrents - the single file will be given the name in "string"
	  instead of being put in a folder of that name
download_files_into_folder(string) - downloads all torrent files into a folder named "string"
        - unlike the above processing, this will always put things in a folder, nothing special

post_processing_steps() - runs the processing steps that are in the post_processing_steps() variable
processing_steps_variable(string) - runs the processing steps that are in varaibale name given



TODO - a list of known shortcomings/bugs
 - you cannot have spaces in the arguments given to the processing steps
 - you cannot have commas in the args being used in the processing steps
    - possible solution - have the string variables parsed before splitting
        - then expanded values can't have commas either....
    - possible solution - safe split with backslashes escaping the commas that are not deliminators
    - or just tell people that they can use a second var to hide the comma
