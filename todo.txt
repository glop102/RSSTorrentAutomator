sftp - elegantly handle if the local location is a directory, and just sove the remote item into the directory
 - need to slightly rework progress reporting to track number of files left/done for the percentage
sftp - add in an optional file download resume support
ioqueue - consider letting the queue be restarted so a person can effectivly pause everything to look around and then restart it
fileio - add some new jobs
 - sftpdelete - delete a remote file/directory - mostly for doing cleanup
 - localcopy - making copies of files takes a long time, so no reason to block other things while it happens
 - localmove - sometimes files are across filesystem boundaries and so involes more effort which takes time
