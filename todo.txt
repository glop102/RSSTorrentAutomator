fileio - add some new jobs
 - sftpdelete - delete a remote file/directory - mostly for doing cleanup
 - localcopy - making copies of files takes a long time, so no reason to block other things while it happens
 - localmove - sometimes files are across filesystem boundaries and so involes more effort which takes time

torrents - add transmission support - https://transmission-rpc.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.0/client.html
torrents - rtorrent - cache results that will never change

processing - setPermissions(location,filepermissions,directorypermissions=None) - set the permissions to filepermissions recursively (if directorypermissions is given, that is applied to directories instead of filepermissions)
